Simple Calculator using C++


Created a simple calculator using C++ programming language.
Uses a while loop to allow for the user to have multiple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with two numbers.
The user inputs two numbers when prompted and give the type of operation when asked (+, -, *, /). 
If the user divides by 0 or gives a operation that was not specified by the prompt a message will be displayed stating that the user cannot divide by 0 or that the operation that was chosen is not recognized.

This was a fun and simple project, and I will be working on making a more complex Caluclator Program in the future.
